![Sample app icon](full/icon_full_128.png)

This directory contains the icons that are displayed for your app. Feel free to
change them.

The difference between the icons on Mac and the other platforms is that on Mac,
they contain a ~5% transparent margin. This is because otherwise they look too
big (eg. in the Dock or in the app switcher).
